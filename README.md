## Minimum Lovable Products

An interesting software engineering article I found was about focusing on creating [Minimum Lovable Products](https://medium.com/@mddunn/minimum-lovable-product-fbe5f4b525e5).

> A minimum lovable product is a product increment that solves a small scope of a meaningful business problem (minimum) that is available and reliable, fast, bug and defect-free, actually solves the problem, and is easy — even fun and delightful — to use (lovable). Instead of debating whether to build iteratively OR pursue a minimum lovable product, we must build iteratively AND pursue a minimum lovable product.

I had originally thought the way that most people did: incremental development stages should be focused on producing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). After all, that is what minimizes the development time right? But this article showed me a new perspective--simply creating a MVP isn't enough. Building a product is about solving your users' needs, and if your MVP doesn't actually achieve that, then a working product doesn't even really matter. Instead, we should focus on creating a MLP by choosing the "minimum set of features needed to solve your user’s problems, and make them as delightful as possible". That way, we can still build iteractively and meet deadlines while also ensuring we're meeting our users' needs.

I couldn't agree with Shannon more -- this article really gave me a new perspective on product building. I thought it was particularly interesting how Dan Olsen adopted Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs to create 'Olsen's Hierarchy of Web User Needs.' Great find, Shannon!
